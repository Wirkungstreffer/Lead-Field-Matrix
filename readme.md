The objective of our project is to construct a lead-field matrix corresponding to the Automated Anatomical Labeling 2 (AAL2) atlas and standard 1020 electroencephalography (EEG) electrode configuration, utilizing computational resources such as the MNE Python or the Matlab FieldTrip toolbox. Upon acquisition of the matrix, it will be integrated into the neurolib framework.

The details are written in the lead-field matrix paper
