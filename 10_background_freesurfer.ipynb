        "# FreeSurfer MRI reconstruction\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial covers how to use FreeSurfer alongside MNE-Python, to handle the\n",
        "structural MRI data that we use to build subject-specific anatomical models of\n",
        "the scalp, inner/outer skull, and cortical surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "FreeSurfer is an open source analysis toolbox for MRI data, available from\n",
        "https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/. FreeSurfer provides graphical interfaces\n",
        "for visualizing MRI data, several anatomical parcellations useful for creating\n",
        "region-of-interest (ROI) labels, template brains such as ``fsaverage``, and\n",

        "within the brain volume).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## First steps\n",
        "\n",
        "After downloading and installing FreeSurfer, there are a few steps to set up\n",
        "the environment. First is to define an environment variable ``FREESURFER_HOME``\n",
        "and then run the FreeSurfer setup script:\n",
        "\n",
        "```console\n",
        "$ export FREESURFER_HOME=/path/to/FreeSurfer\n",

        "    installation guide`_ for more info.</p></div>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important step is to tell FreeSurfer where to put the anatomical\n",
        "reconstructions of your research subjects. This is done with an environment\n",
        "variable called ``SUBJECTS_DIR``, which will contain the individual subjects'\n",
        "reconstructions in separate sub-folders.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Anatomical reconstruction\n",
        "\n",
        "The first processing stage is the creation of various surface reconstructions.\n",
        "Usually a full FreeSurfer reconstruction is obtained by the following commands:\n",
        "\n",
        "```console\n",
        "$ my_subject=sample\n",
        "$ my_NIfTI=/path/to/NIfTI.nii.gz\n",
        "$ recon-all -i $my_NIfTI -s $my_subject -all\n",
        "```\n",
        "where ``i`` stands for \"input\" and ``s`` for \"subject\". Executing this will\n",
        "create the folder :file:`$SUBJECTS_DIR/sample` and populate it\n",
        "with several subfolders (``bem``, ``label``, ``mri``, etc). See also the\n",
